Initial import of v1.0.13 for Firefox 3+ and Internet Explorer 6+

2011-07-29
----------

Built v1.0.13, which makes the following changes:

*   No longer removes all cookies from hosts which have opt-out cookies on
    startup. The extension continues to properly set and maintain opt-out
    cookies, but ignores non-opt-out cookies completely.

*   Updates to the latest version of the DAA registry.

2011-03-18
----------

Built v1.0.11, which makes the following changes:

*   Localizes the extension's description into lots and lots of languages.

*   Updates to version 6 of the NAI registry, adding AppNexus, Magnetic, and
    bumping Microsoft and Media6Degrees with new data.

----------

Released v1.0.10, which makes the following changes:

*   Prepares for localization of the extension description and title (still
    English-only right now).

*   Whitelists non-opt-out cookies from `.yahoo.com` to work around an
    accidental logout on browser start.  I'm not happy with this as a final
    solution, but it'll do until I have more time to investigate why simply
    whitelisting the `B` cookie isn't enough.

First public release: v1.0.9.
